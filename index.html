    A dog’s tongue is pretty incredible when you think about it. Your pooch uses their tongue to eat and drink, to help cool down their body, and, of course, to give you tons of slobbery kisses. Some dogs — maybe even your own — have a bizarre
     but adorable trait of sticking their tongues out all of the time. Sometimes it’s just the tip; other times their entire tongues are hanging out of the sides of their mouths. While this can be a harmless, endearing trait, it can also be a signal of underlying health issues. Here are four possible reasons why your dog’s tongue sticks out.

   <p>Spina bifida in dogs is a congenital condition that occurs when a dog’s spine and spinal cord fail to develop properly during early gestation. This condition belongs to a group of disorders known as neural tube defects. The neural tube is the embryonic structure that eventually develops into a dog’s brain, spinal cord, and the tissues
     that enclose them. When part of the neural tube fails to close all the way, the result is spina bifida. As such, it is a relatively rare condition, primarily occurring in the lumbar or sacral regions of the spine.
